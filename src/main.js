 * clicked him, hover and leave fired in the wake of it, and the whole thing
 * read as the app twitching rather than answering.
 *
 * So the fixed point is *him*, not a corner of the window: the renderer says
 * where he stands inside the layout it just measured (`anchorIn`), and
 * whatever the placement rules picked is shifted so that point lands where he
 * already was. The window may end up further left, right, up or down; he does
 * not move at all.
 *
 * The first placement has nothing to hold still — that is when his spot is
 * decided — and an explicit move (a drag, a perch, "organize") is a request
 * to put him somewhere else, so both re-anchor rather than resist.
