 *
 * `facing` says which way the art is drawn — "right" (the default), "left", or
 * "center" for art that looks straight out of the screen. Clippy turns a buddy
 * around by mirroring the sprite, so a pack drawn facing left needs to say so
 * or it will walk backwards, and a "center" pack is never mirrored at all.
 * Any single animation can override it (see `poses` below), because a sheet
 * that walks to the left often sits facing the viewer.
 *
 * `climbs` (default false) says the art can be turned on its side, so a buddy
 * walking up or down a screen edge is rotated to face the way it is going
 * rather than sliding along sideways. Art drawn standing on its feet should
 * leave this alone; art drawn from above — a snake, a crab — should set it.
 *
 * Packs that put every animation in one grid — a row per animation, which is
 * how most pet sprite sheets ship — say so instead, and can name as many of the
 * poses as the sheet actually has:
 *
 *   { "frameWidth": 192, "frameHeight": 208, "columns": 8, "rows": 9,
 *     "poses": {
 *       "idle":    { "file": "spritesheet.webp", "row": 0, "frames": 6,
 *                    "facing": "center" },
 *       "excited": { "file": "spritesheet.webp", "row": 3, "frames": 4 },
 *       "walk":    { "file": "spritesheet.webp", "row": 1, "frames": 8,
 *                    "facing": "left" }
 *     } }
 *
 * Sprite packs stay *out* of this repo — that folder is gitignored, so whatever
 * you drop in keeps its own licence and never ends up redistributed here.
