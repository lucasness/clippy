 * Chatting with the *pet*, not with the agent it watches.

 * Everything else in the panel talks to the coding session: the composer types
 * into its terminal, the cards answer its hooks. This is the other thing —
 * saying hello to the buddy sitting on your screen and getting a sentence back
 * in character.
 *
 * Why not route it through the watched session? The hook API is one-shot:
 * Claude Code calls us, we answer, the exchange is over. There is no channel a
 * hook can use to start a conversation with a session that is already running,
 * so an aside typed here would land in that session's prompt as work — exactly
 * what "chat with the pet, not with the agent" is asking us not to do. Instead
 * the pet gets its own tiny Agent SDK query: no tools, no repo settings, a
 * small model, and a persona that knows who it is and which session it sits on.
 *
 * The SDK is an optional dependency (it bundles the `claude` binary), so it is
 * lazy-imported on first use and its absence is a message, not a crash — the
 * same deal Drive mode makes. Pass `runQuery` to inject a fake in tests.
