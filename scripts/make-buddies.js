 * stroke has hung its own thickness off each end, still comfortably narrower
 * than it is high.
 *
 * Across it isn't even one scale. A straight squeeze leaves the hook and the
 * outer right leg a single pixel apart, and a one-pixel gap is no gap at all
 * once the outline pass has been past it; so the right-hand stretch of the
 * viewBox is compressed rather less than the left, which buys that gap its
 * second pixel. The three numbers below are also picked so all three legs you
